# UCLA Demographics Data Visualization

## To-Do
- make corresponding legend elements bold on hover (refer to [this](http://jsfiddle.net/vedmack/cuaBX/))
- add more stuff to the slider, update the json file (demographics-correct.json)
- maybe use [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com)?
- either
	1. implement [line graphs](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1256572) on hover of the elements
	2. or don't 
- either
	1. have 3 donut charts (ethnicity, geographic origin, gender)
	2. have a filter for the demographics and just show 1 at a time
- have a negative bar chart to show the top trends (highest growth stuff, lowest growth stuff)
